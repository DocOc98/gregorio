# The "language" keyword indicates that the rules which follow are for the
# specified language.  It must be followed by the language name enclosed in
# square brackets and a semicolon.  The language specified applies until the
# next language statement.
language [English];

# The "vowel" keyword indicates that the characters which follow, until the
# next semicolon, should be considered vowels.  There may be multiple "vowel"
# statements, and the characters following all of them will be considered
# vowels.  Gregorio does no case folding, so upper- and lower-case characters
# should be listed.

# The "prefix" keyword lists strings of characters which end in a vowel, but
# when followed by a sequence of vowels, SHOULD NOT be considered part of the
# vowel sound.  These strings follow the keyword and must be separated by space
# and end with a semicolon.  There may be multiple "prefix" statements, and all
# will apply.  Examples of prefixes include "i" and "u" in Latin and "qu" in
# English.  As with vowels, Gregorio does no case folding, so upper- and
# lower-case combinations should be listed.
prefix qu Qu qU QU;
prefix gu Gu gU GU;
prefix y Y;

# The "suffix" keyword lists strings of characters which don't start with a
# vowel, but when appearing after a sequence of vowels, SHOULD be considered
# part of the vowel sound.  These strings follow the keyword and must be
# separated by space and end with a semicolon.  There may be multiple "suffix"
# statements, and all will apply.  Examples of suffixes include "w" and "we" in
# English and "y" in Spanish.  As with vowels, Gregorio does no case folding,
# so upper- and lower-case combinations should be listed.
