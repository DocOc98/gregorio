\section{Lyric Centering}

Gregorio centers the text of each syllable around the first note of each
syllable.  There are two basic modes: \verb:\setlyriccentering{syllable}:
and \verb:\setlyriccentering{vowel}:.  In \texttt{syllable} mode, the
entire syllable is centered around the first note.  This is common in
modern music.  In \texttt{vowel} mode, the vowel sound of the syllable is
centered around the first note.  This is common in most Gregorian chant
books with text in Latin.

The default rules built into Gregorio for \texttt{vowel} mode are for
Ecclesiatical Latin and work fairly well (though not perfectly) for
other languages (especially Romance languages).  However, Gregorio
provides a gabc \texttt{language} header which allows the language of
the lyrics to be set.  This will cause Gregorio to look for a file
called \textit{specified-language}\texttt{.vwl} amongst the GregorioTeX
files or in your working directory.  If it finds such a file (henceforce
called the vowel file), Gregorio will use the rules contained within for
vowel centering.  If it doesn't find such a file of if it is unable to
read the file for any reason, Gregorio will fall back on the Latin
rules.  You may wish to enable warnings (by passing the \texttt{-W}
argument to \texttt{gregorio}), if there is a problem, for more
information.

The vowel file is a list of statements, each starting with a keyword and
ending with a semicolon (\texttt{;}).  Multiple statements with the same
keyword are allowed, and all will apply.  Comments start with a hash
symbol (\texttt{\#}) and end at the end of the line.

In general, Gregorio does no case folding, so the keywords are
case-sensitive and both upper- and lower-case characters should be
listed after the keywords if they should both be considered in their
given categories.


The keywords are:

\begin{description}

\item[vowel]

The \texttt{vowel} keyword indicates that the characters which follow,
until the next semicolon, should be considered vowels.

\item[prefix]

The \texttt{prefix} keyword lists strings of characters which end in a
vowel, but when followed by a sequence of vowels, \emph{should not} be
considered part of the vowel sound.  These strings follow the keyword
and must be separated by space and end with a semicolon.  Examples of
prefixes include \emph{i} in Latin and \emph{qu} in English.

\item[suffix]

The \texttt{suffix} keyword lists strings of characters which don't
start with a vowel, but when appearing after a sequence of vowels,
\emph{should} be considered part of the vowel sound.  These strings
follow the keyword and must be separated by space and end with a
semicolon.  Examples of suffixes include \emph{w} and \emph{we} in
English and \emph{y} in Spanish.

By way of example, here is a vowel file that works for English:

\begin{lstlisting}
